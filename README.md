# particle-motion-magnetic-mirror
Project simulating charged particle motion in a magnetic mirror using Euler, RK2, RK4, and Boris methods.
## Physical Model
- Charged particle motion governed by the Lorentz force.
- Magnetic field generated by two point dipoles placed symmetrically along the x-axis.
- Analysis includes particle trajectory, magnetic moment, and kinetic energy.
## Numerical Methods
The equations of motion are solved using:
- Euler Method
- Second-Order Runge–Kutta (RK2)
- Fourth-Order Runge–Kutta (RK4)
- Boris Method
## Language and libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Numba (for JIT acceleration)
- Google Colab
## Results
- Particle trajectories trapped in the magnetic mirror.
- Magnetic moment approximately conserved.
- Comparison of kinetic energy conservation across methods.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/particle-motion-magnetic-mirror.git
2. Install Dependencies
